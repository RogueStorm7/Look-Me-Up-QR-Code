## Description
**Look Me Up** is RESTful API QR Code Resume application, that allows the user to have someone scan the QR code it takes them to the social media profile on FaceBook, Instagram, LinkDin, GitHub and Twitter. This works across all devices and is convenient for people to network and share their information with others.

## Motivation for Development
